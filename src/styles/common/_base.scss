// Future-proof rule: in browsers that support :focus-visible, suppress the focus outline
// on elements that programmatically receive focus but wouldn't normally show a visible
// focus outline. In general, this would mean that the outline is only applied if the
// interaction that led to the element receiving programmatic focus was a keyboard interaction,
// or the browser has somehow determined that the user is primarily a keyboard user and/or
// wants focus outlines to always be presented.
// See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus-visible
// and https://developer.paciellogroup.com/blog/2018/03/focus-visible-and-backwards-compatibility/
